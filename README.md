# sorting-algorithm-review
Relearning how to implement common sorting algorithms. I plan on doing each in python first, and might redo them in other languages later.

## TO-DO:
- ~~Bubble Sort~~
- ~~Selection Sort~~
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Counting Sort
- Radix Sort
- Bucket Sort
